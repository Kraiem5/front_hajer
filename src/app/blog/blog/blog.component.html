    Harnessing the Power of Signals and Standalone Components in Angular
  </h1>
  <div class="section px-8 my-12">
    <h2 class="text-gray-700">Introduction:</h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description">
      Angular has been a cornerstone of web development for years, offering a
      robust framework for building complex and dynamic applications. However,
      with recent advancements, Angular has introduced exciting new features
      like standalone components and signals, paving the way for a more
      streamlined and efficient development experience.

  <div class="section px-8 my-12">
    <h2 class="text-gray-700">What are Standalone Components?</h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description">
      Standalone components break away from the traditional
      <strong>NgModule</strong>
      architecture, allowing you to define components independently. This means
      you no longer need to register them in modules, significantly simplifying
      component creation and reducing boilerplate code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section px-8 my-12">
    <h2 class="text-gray-700">What are Signals?</h2>
    <p class="px-4 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description">
      Signals provide a reactive way to communicate between components,
      injecting data and updates without relying on traditional dependency
      injection or event emitters. This leads to cleaner code and facilitates
      data sharing across components without complex hierarchies.

        <p
          class="px-2 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description"
        >
          Standalone components contribute to greater modularity within your
          application, making it easier to understand, maintain, and test
          individual components.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
        <h4 class="text-gray-700 sub-title">Reduced boilerplate:</h4>
        <p
          class="px-2 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description"
        >
          Eliminating the need for NgModules reduces boilerplate code, allowing
          you to focus on component functionality and logic.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
        <h4 class="text-gray-700 sub-title">Enhanced code clarity:</h4>
        <p
          class="px-2 text-gray-600 text-md leading-relaxed section-description"
